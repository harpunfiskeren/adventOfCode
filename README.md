## 🎅 This repo contains my solutions to [Advent Of Code](https://adventofcode.com/).

I've decided to write my solutions in [GO](https://go.dev/) since I've yet to learn a language that can directly
manipulate memory with pointers. It also looks nice.

### 📜 Rules for myself

- No LLM/code completions allowed. Except for writing tests, of course.
- No looking up the answer.

### ⭐ Style guide for myself

- Focus on readability
- Prefer helper functions with clear names over large blocks of code
